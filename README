GalacticExamples is a Visual Studio 2013 solution that contains example projects that demonstrate various aspects of the Galactic API. It uses the SharedLibraries project as a central place to access Galactic API DLLs and access third-party libraries necessary for the project but not available via NuGet.

This repository should generally be placed at the same level in the directory structure as the SharedLibraries project.

For example:

If you place the SharedLibraries project in: C:\Users\Username\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\SharedLibraries
then this project should be placed in: C:\Users\Username\Documents\Visual Studio 2013\Projects\GalacticExamples
